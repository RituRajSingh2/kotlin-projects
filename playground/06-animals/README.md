# Animals

A small project to learn about subclasses and superclasses.

## Features

- avoiding duplicate code with inheritance.
- designing an animal class inheritance structure.
- using IS-A and HAS-A to test class hierarchy and relationships.
- declaring the superclass with open.
- overriding properties and functions in a subclass with override and final override.
- declaring a class as abstract to stop it from being instantiated.
- defining common behavior with interfaces.
- checking the type with the is operator.
- performing an explicit cast with the as operator.
- comparing a variable with a when expression.
